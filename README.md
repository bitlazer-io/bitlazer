# Bitlazer: Lightpaper

**Date:** August 11, 2024

## Introduction

Bitlazer is a revolutionary Bitcoin Layer 3 (L3) project that leverages advanced Arbitrum Orbitrum technology to bring unprecedented scalability and efficiency to the Bitcoin ecosystem. By enabling seamless bridging of WBTC and native BTC payments on a robust L3 layer, Bitlazer aims to create a thriving smart contracts ecosystem. This ecosystem is designed to be cheap, fast, and scalable, driving the next generation of blockchain innovation.

## Value Proposition Summary

1. **Ultra-Fast Bitcoin-Paid Transactions:**  
   Bitlazer enables transactions paid in Bitcoin with lightning-fast speeds of less than 1 second and transaction costs below 1 cent. This makes it an ideal solution for microtransactions, everyday purchases, and other use cases where speed and low cost are paramount.

2. **Security and Smart Contracts:**  
   Bitlazer will derive its security directly from the Bitcoin network, ensuring the highest level of security for its users. It will also offer the freedom to develop and deploy smart contracts using the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and WebAssembly (WASM) through Arbitrum Stylus.

3. **BTC Native Bridging:**  
   Bitlazer will introduce Layer 3 BTC native bridging using light clients integrated with Arbitrum Stylus native WASM contracts. This will enable seamless, trustless, and decentralized bridging of BTC within the Bitlazer ecosystem.

4. **Dual Staking Rewards:**  
   Bitlazer offers a dual staking rewards program that incentivizes both L3 BTC staking and LZRD token staking, creating a robust incentive structure for long-term participation and ecosystem growth.

## Bitlazer’s Mission

Bitlazer’s mission is to create a seamless, scalable, and secure ecosystem where Bitcoin can be used not only as a store of value but also as a functional currency for everyday transactions and as a foundation for smart contracts. By combining the strengths of Bitcoin with cutting-edge layer-3 technology, Bitlazer aims to drive the next evolution of blockchain technology.

## Technical Overview

The Bitlazer platform is built on top of Arbitrum Orbitrum technology, enabling scalability and high-speed transactions by leveraging an L3 layer that operates above the traditional L1 and L2 layers. The initial launch will focus on bridging WBTC to the L3 native currency, supporting payments in native BTC, and building a cost-effective and scalable smart contracts ecosystem.

As Bitlazer evolves, it will integrate additional features, such as Layer 3 BTC native bridging via light clients and optimize transaction sequencing and withdrawal processing.

## Roadmap

1. **Initial Launch and Bridging:**  
   Enable the bridging of WBTC to the L3 native currency and support payments in native BTC.

2. **Ecosystem Bootstrap with LZRD Airdrop:**  
   Conduct an airdrop of 20% of the LZRD tokens to early community builders.

3. **Native BTC Bridge via Light Client:**  
   Implement a native BTC bridge through a light client using Stylus smart contracts.

4. **Native Sequencing and Withdrawal Processing:**  
   Optimize transaction sequencing and withdrawal processing for native BTC requests.

## LZRD Tokenomics

The total supply of LZRD is 1,000,000,000 tokens, distributed as follows:

1. **Staking Rewards (30%):** 300,000,000 LZRD
- L3 Native BTC Staking: 20% (200,000,000 LZRD)
- LZRD Staking: 10% (100,000,000 LZRD)

2. **Team and Strategic Sales (40%):** 400,000,000 LZRD
- Team Allocation: 25% (250,000,000 LZRD)
- Strategic Sales and Partnerships: 15% (150,000,000 LZRD)

3. **Ecosystem Builders and Community Incentives (30%):** 300,000,000 LZRD
- Airdrop for Early Builders: 20% (200,000,000 LZRD)
- Community Incentives and Grants: 10% (100,000,000 LZRD)

This structure balances the need for early growth and development with long-term sustainability, ensuring that all stakeholders in the Bitlazer ecosystem are appropriately incentivized.
